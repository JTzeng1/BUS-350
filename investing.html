    <h1>Investing Basics</h1>
    <p>A beginner-friendly guide for students who want to start investing.</p>


    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        The most valuable asset someone could invest in is themselves. Yes, more money is better, but you have to make sure it fits in your budget. 
        Invest as early as possible to take advantage of compound interest. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>What is investing?</h4></li>
        <p>Investing is using money to buy assets with the goal of "growing" your money.</p>
        <li><h4>Why invest early?</h4></li>
        <p>Starting early allows your investments to benefit from compound interest, where the returns you earn also generate their own returns over time.</p>
        <li><h4>Different types of investments</h4></li>
        <p>Common investment options include stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, and real estate.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>
        Before you start investing, it's important to set clear financial goals and understand your risk tolerance. 
        Research different investment options and consider consulting with a financial advisor (most likely a trusted adult like a parent).
    </p>
    <h3>Figuring Out Your Goals</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>Short-term goals</h4></li>
        <p>Goals you want to achieve within the next 1-3 years, such as saving for a vacation or a new gadget.</p>
        <li><h4>Long-term goals</h4></li>
        <p>Goals that are more than 3 years away, like buying a house or saving for retirement.</p>
    </ul>
